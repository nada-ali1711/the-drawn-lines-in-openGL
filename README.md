# the-drawn-lines-in-openGL
create OpenGL project to mplement an application that handle user input at runtime. Input handling shouldbe as follows:

When user presses ‘+’ button,a new point should be drawn at random location within application window.

When user presses ‘-’ button,the last point drawn should be erased.

For every two successive points,a line should be drawn connecting them. 

A point is allowed to be part of only one lineso that number of line is the half number of points.(note: if number of points is odd, thelast point will not be part of any line untill user adds anew point).
